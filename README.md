# UNM Student Resource App (UNM-SR)

UNM-SR is a resource application for all UNM students. The goal of this app is to connect students to clubs, organizations, resources and events on campus.
For new and continuing students, finding and connecting with communities and friends with similar interests could be challenging especially in recently times due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. 
UNM-SR empowers students to **explore**, **discover** and **connect** with student clubs, organizations and other on-campus resources, as well as their respective events and updated.
Currently, UNM-SR displays UNM events from the [UNM Open data store](https://opendata.unm.edu/) and data on a few 
student organizations from the [UNM Student Activities Center](https://unm-community.symplicity.com/index.php?s=student_group)

---
UNM-SR was built using [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/), is an open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React.
